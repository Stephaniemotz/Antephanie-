Right now our program only takes in command line input, but we would like for it to move to file input (standard input) in the future

Input:
             independent weight = 1.0078
             reactants (weight <= 1.0078) { 
                  formula("hydrogen");​
               }   ​
                  products {​
                  formula("not hydrogen");​
                  }
      Output: 
            hydrogen
