Right now our program only takes in command line input, but we would like for it to move to file input (standard input) in the future


******EXAMPLES FOR PRESENTATION*************

1 [P] 2         //shows how they go to double and the basic structure of our design 
2.0 [S] 3.0     //Shows the usage with doubles this Time (to represent the atomic weight)
[Li] [Ge] [Ne]  //Shows off a few more of our token types
2.0[In]         //Increment Example
--> 1 <--       //left and right bracket: since we used typical brackets for the token types we needed to think of a different alternative
#H20 H20#       //Start Comment and End Comment
Periodic        //Represents the period

//Error Checking Examples
Ts]             //Syntax error: The lexer needs to recognize a left bracket first, so it will throw 3 errors messages
[Ts             //Syntax error:Recognizes the left bracket, so only throws one error
--              //Syntax error: unexpected Token (differs from chemical reaction error)
[HH]            //DNE: If the token type isn't recognize at all in the system will print out error with the input next to it
